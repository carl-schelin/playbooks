## chkcentrify Script

Description: The **chkcentrify** script is specific for Centrify based systems. The script runs **adinfo** and returns an error if the system is not joined to a domain.

* Location: [server]:bin/chkcentrify
* Errors Logged: [server]:var/unixsuite.log

There doesn't appear to be a process or script to check the error.

Note that the **chkserver** script does check the status of Centrify including if it's joined to a domain.
