# chkserver - Check the postinstall steps where possible
# Owner: Carl Schelin
# 2013/05/21
# Description: Run through the defined steps to quickly see what might need to be done
#   on a system to complete the installation.
# 2013/05/21 - CS - Fixed spelling on a couple of items. Added check of root's cron if intrado script hasn't been run yet
# 2017/05/22 - CS - Removed extra interfaces, count interfaces to see if routes need to be checked
