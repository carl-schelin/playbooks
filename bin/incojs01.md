Description: This is a [server] script. It's intended to be run on the [server] server. [server] is the hostname of the server.

* This script is installed in /opt/intrado/bin/[server]

The intrado script will run a [server] script if when the intrado script runs, it's on the [server] server. This lets you create a script that's intended to run on just the server identified as [server].

The script can do anything specifically for targeted server.


The incojs01 script validates the integrity of the mysql database files and reports an error if found.
